**Practice single-cell RNA-seq analysis with Scanpy ‚Äî step-by-step, notebook by notebook.**

This repository is a hands-on playground to learn [Scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/) and build reproducible single-cell analysis pipelines. Each notebook is a focused exercise covering the complete workflow: download datasets, preprocess, find highly variable genes, reduce dimensionality, cluster, identify marker genes, annotate cell types, and train ML/AI models.

## üëã About This Project

Hi! I'm **NM0001**, a pharmacist by training with a deep passion for research and science. My current focus is on **AI/ML applications in life sciences**, and this repository is part of my **#BuildInPublic** journey.

### Why This Repository?

I've always dreamed of becoming a professor one day, and what better way to start than by teaching now? This repository is designed as if I'm my own Professor ‚Äî breaking down complex concepts, explaining the "why" behind each step, and making single-cell analysis accessible.

**My philosophy**: 
- **Pedagogy first** - *"Ce que l'on con√ßoit bien s'√©nonce clairement, et les mots pour le dire arrivent ais√©ment."* ‚Äî Nicolas Boileau
- **Science meets code** - *"L'intelligence artificielle et la biologie computationnelle ouvrent une nouvelle √®re : celle o√π l'on peut enfin mod√©liser la complexit√© du vivant, non plus comme une m√©taphore, mais comme une r√©alit√© calculable."* ‚Äî Jean-Pierre Changeux
- **Student one day, professor another** - *"La vie est un apprentissage permanent ; plus on croit savoir, moins on sait, tant les choses changent, et avec elles les mentalit√©s."* ‚Äî Yasmina Khadra

Whether you're a student, researcher, or fellow learner, I hope these notebooks help you master single-cell RNA-seq analysis!
